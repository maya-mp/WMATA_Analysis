    "\n",
    "# **Phase 2: Identifying Low and High Ridership Season**\n",
    "**Goal:** Investigate which season has the **least and most** ridership for targeted advertising, metro resource/funding allocation, event - trend prediction (whatever we decide).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Guiding Questions:**\n",
    "1. Which season shows the least and most ridership overall?\n",
    "   - Focus on seasonal ridership to identify trends in traffic, especially during the winter and summer months.\n",
    "   - Look at the average daily entries by season and compare ridership trends across seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do ridership patterns vary by month within each season?\n",
    "   - Determine if specific months contribute significantly to low ridership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initial Visualizations:**\n",
    "1. **Seasonal Ridership Comparison (Bar Plot):**\n",
    "   - **Y-Axis**: Total ridership per season (sum of ridership for each month within that season).\n",
    "   - **X-Axis**: Seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).\n",
    "   - This will help visually compare the total ridership in each season.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monthly Ridership within Seasons (Line Plot):**\n",
    "   - **Y-Axis**: Average ridership.\n",
    "   - **X-Axis**: Months.\n",
    "   - Helps identify monthly spikes or dips within each season.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Phase 3: Analyzing Commuter & College Student Usage (if we stil want these stakeholders)**\n",
    "**Goal:** Find out which stations/lines are most used by **commuters** (workdays) and **college students** (evenings/weekends). **Note: the metro stations dataframe has station types for job and student which you can use to narrow station exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Guiding Questions:**\n",
    "1. What are the peak commute stations during weekdays over the whole year?\n",
    "   - Focus on the morning and evening commute hours (6:00-9:30 AM and 3:00-7:00 PM).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which stations are heavily used by college students?\n",
    "   - Identify stations close to major universities (e.g., GW, UMD) and check ridership during evenings and weekends.\n",
    "   -**Use the \"STATION_TYPE\" column to narrow this down**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initial Visualizations:**\n",
    "1. **Weekday Commuter Station Usage (Bar Plot):**\n",
    "   - **Y-Axis**: Total ridership (AM & PM peak).\n",
    "   - **X-Axis**: Station names.\n",
    "   - This will show where commuters are most likely using the Metro during work hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evening/Weekend Student Usage (Bar Plot or Heatmap):**\n",
    "   - **Y-Axis**: Stations.\n",
    "   - **X-Axis**: Time of Day (e.g., Evening, Late Night).\n",
    "   - Show which stations are heavily used during weekends and evenings, especially near university hubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Phase 4: Identifying Weekend Event Traffic**\n",
    "**Goal:** Investigate which stations have high ridership during weekends, correlating with major events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Guiding Questions:**\n",
    "1. Which stations show the highest ridership on weekends?\n",
    "   - Look at stations used for events or major tourist attractions (e.g., National Mall, stadiums, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are there specific stations with increased ridership due to events?\n",
    "   - Check if stations near stadiums or tourist spots show higher usage on weekends (e.g., Nationals Park, museums).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initial Visualizations:**\n",
    "1. **Weekend Ridership by Station (Bar Plot):**\n",
    "   - **Y-Axis**: Total ridership for weekends.\n",
    "   - **X-Axis**: Stations.\n",
    "   - This will show which stations are most frequently used on weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event-Related Traffic (Event-driven Ridership Map):**\n",
    "   - Overlay the ridership patterns for stations near major venues (stadiums, concert halls) to identify if events influence ridership.\n",
    "   - You could potentially map these stations or add event annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Next Steps After Visualizations:**\n",
    "- Review insights from the plots and adjust focus to answer specific questions.\n",
    "- **Refine data scope**: Narrow focus to the top stations or lines that show the highest ridership trends.Or we can focus on the ones with the least and how to increase people using the metro on the weekends since those rates are lower than weekdays. This would increase metro usage and also increase local DC business. We can regroup and rediscuss other ideas after the initial viz are made.\n"
