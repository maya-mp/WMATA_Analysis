# 🚇 DC Metro Ridership Analysis 🚇

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Washington, D.C.'s Metro ridership trends** to help transit planners and businesses optimize services and marketing strategies. Using publicly available ridership data, we explore seasonal trends, station-specific traffic, and metro line performance.

## 🔍 Research Questions
We aim to answer the following questions:

### 1️. Overall Ridership Trends (Big Picture for Metro & Businesses)
- What season has the highest overall ridership?
- What months have the highest overall ridership?

### 2. Metro Line Analysis (Broad Perspective → Business Relevance)
- Which metro lines handle the most ridership overall?
- How does ridership fluctuate across metro lines by month?

### 3. Station-Specific Ridership (Metro Service & Business Insights Together)
- What are the **top 10 busiest stations** each month?
- What are the **middle 10 most used stations** each month?
- What are the **10 least busy stations** each month?

### 4. Metro Line & Station Type Analysis (Service & Business Insights Together)
- How is ridership distributed across metro stations and lines over time?
- How many stations of each type (residential, commercial, transfer) exist on each metro line?
- Which station types (residential, commercial, transfer) handle the most traffic?

### 5. Business-Driven Optimization (Closing with Data-Backed Opportunities)
- Can Metro adjust pricing based on congestion?

## 📊 Data Sources & Processing
- **Data Collection:** Raw data obtained from **WMATA Metrorail Ridership Summary** and **WMATA Corridor Data Maps.**
- **Data Processing:**  
  - Cleaned and normalized data for better analysis  
  - Merged relevant columns into structured **dataframes**  
  - Used Python libraries for analysis (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations
Key visualizations include:
- **Ridership Trends**: Histogram of average daily ridership by season and month
- **Metro Line Analysis**: Total ridership per metro line, monthly trends
- **Station Ridership**: Line graphs for busiest, mid-range, and least busy stations
- **Station & Line Breakdown**: Heatmaps, bar charts, and pie charts to analyze station types and ridership distribution
- **Business Optimization**: Dynamic pricing model for Metro revenue and congestion management

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project
### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`,  `pypalettes`
